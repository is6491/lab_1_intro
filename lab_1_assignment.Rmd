### Objectives

* Learn the basics of using RStudio Cloud
* Create an R Markdown document
* Bring data into R
* Perform simple data transformation tasks

### Assignment

* Start the assignment in Rstudio Cloud (this will create a version for yourself that I'll be able to see).
* Create a new R Markdown document and give it a snappy title.
* Create a section called "What I want to learn this semster" and write a few sentances about what you hope to get out of this class.
* Create a second section and name it "Working with data"
* Task 1
    * Find one of R's built-in data sets (use the `data()` function for a list).
    * Use one of the simple functions on this data set. Functions include the following.
        * `select`
        * `filter`
        * `arrange`
        * `mutate`
* Task 2
    * Find a data set from the internet, or use a data set you already have. Some good resources below.
        * https://opendata.utah.gov/
        * https://sqlbelle.com/2015/01/16/data-sets-for-bianalyticsvisualization-projects/
        * https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/ 
    * Bring that data into R and store it in a variable.
        * In the file menu in the bottom right pane you'll find a button to upload data from your computer.
        * Two extra points will be awarded if you figure out how to read the data directly from the web.
    * Use `group_by`, `summarize` and the pipe `%>%` operator to perform an aggregation. Note: the aggregation doesn't have to make sense.
* Knit your R Markdown file and upload the html output into Canvas.
